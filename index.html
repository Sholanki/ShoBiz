	<h1>My Journey Starts In Playing </h1>
	<p> I started playing with creation of website today. I have mostly been after certificates but never played with what I have learnt. Today, I started playing and I find an immense pleasure in playing right now. Doing hands on job of finding out code, how to style pages in css, how to do box sizing is giving me an immense joy. Certifications are not necessary that I posses knowledge but today, I started applying.</p> 
	<p>I realized that my certifications are kind of stale wealth, lying about without any value. It reeeks and it stinks until and unless I roll it over and do something about it. My play will continue and I will create new websites or do something about html every single day and invest my time. So today I started doing: <br>
	<h2>What I did so far? </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> I made layout of how my website should look on pen and paper </li>
			<li> I made navigation bar, styled it and made the links </li>
			<li> I got to use box sizing property and made two columns, on left my picture appears and on right, my content appears </li>
			<li> I used href link to navigate to other sites whose pages I still need to create </li>
			<li> I designed header and footer and styled it up </li>
			<li> I used media responsive queries so that the sizing of the screen comes up appropriately if the website is resized </li>
			<li> Designed About web page </li>
			<li> Used icons for Twitter and Git hub using i class </li>
		</ul><br>
	
	<h2>What I will do next? </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Design Contact Page and provide links to it</li>
		</ul><br>
		
	<p>*The contents in sections 'What I did so far' and 'What I will do next' will keep on changing. Wait for updates</p>
